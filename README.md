# VR Scriptable Framework
This repository group a Unity Framework based on the Scriptable Objects. It aims to ease the use of Virtual Reality in a project, and to have a light tool for that, while integrating a cross-platform project and some basic VR features. 

## Description
The Scriptable Objects Framework in this repository is based on the work of [Thorsten Jänichen](https://github.com/TJaenichen) and [Thomas Masquart](https://github.com/ThmsMsqrt), co-authors of this powerful tool. Their work is as well based on the excellent Unite Talk 2017 from Ryan Hipple, [available here](https://youtu.be/raQ3iHhE_Kk), and on its [Scriptable Objects Github repository](https://github.com/roboryantron/Unite2017).

The repository you're currently on is linking the Framework to VR devices and features. It's an alternative to Libraries like VRTK, apart from the fact that this repository is still a work in progress. Numerous tools and scripts will come in the future, as well as other device supports.

The supported devices for now are :
- The HTC Vive
- The Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers
- A VR Simulator


## Credits
I want to thanks [Thomas Masquart](https://github.com/ThmsMsqrt) and [Thorsten Jänichen](https://github.com/TJaenichen) for their works on the Scriptable Framework, and Thorsten more importantly as he created the bases for this VR project.
