# UnityFramework
This repository group a Unity framework based on the Scriptable Objects. 

## Description
<<<<<<< HEAD
The Scriptable Framework in this repository is based on [Scriptable Objects Github repository](https://github.com/roboryantron/Unite2017) and the Unite Talk 2017 [available here](https://youtu.be/raQ3iHhE_Kk) from Ryan Hipple. 

The branch you're currently on is linking the Framework to VR devices. It's an alternative to Libraries like VRTK, except that this repository is still a work in progress. Numerous tools and scripts will come in the future, as well as other device supports.

The supported devices for now are :
- The HTC Vive
- The Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers
- A VR Simulator
