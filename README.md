# UnityFramework
This repository group a Unity framework based on the Scriptable Objects. 

## Description
The Scriptable Framework in this repository is based on Scriptable Objects and the Unite Talk 2017 [available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk&t=1884s). 

The branch you're currently on is linking the Framework to VR devices. It's an alternative to Libraries like VRTK, except that this repository is still a work in progress. Numerous tools and scripts will come in the future, as well as other device supports.

The supported devices for now are :
- The HTC Vive
- The Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers
- A VR Simulator
